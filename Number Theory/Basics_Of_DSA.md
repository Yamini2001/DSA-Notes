📘 Basics of DSA (Logic Building Notes)
1️⃣ What is DSA?
DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) is about:
-> Storing data efficiently (Data Structures)

-> Solving problems step-by-step (Algorithms)

👉 Goal: Write optimized, readable, and scalable code.

2️⃣ Why DSA is Important?
-> Improves problem-solving skills
-> Helps crack coding interviews
-> Makes code faster and memory-efficient
-> Teaches how to think logically

3️⃣ Time & Space Complexity (Very Important)
⏱ Time Complexity

Tells how fast an algorithm runs as input grows.

Common notations:

O(1) → Constant

O(log n) → Binary Search

O(n) → Single loop

O(n²) → Nested loops

👉 Focus on how loops grow, not exact time.

💾 Space Complexity

Extra memory used by an algorithm.

4️⃣ Basic Data Structures
📌 Arrays

Stores elements in continuous memory

Fast access using index

Use when:

Fixed size

Frequent access

📌 Strings

Sequence of characters

Important for parsing & manipulation

Common operations:

Reverse

Frequency count

Palindrome check

📌 Linked List

Nodes connected using pointers

Dynamic size

Types:

Singly

Doubly

Circular

📌 Stack (LIFO)

Last In, First Out

Uses:

Undo/Redo

Function calls

Expression evaluation

📌 Queue (FIFO)

First In, First Out

Uses:

Scheduling

BFS

Task management

5️⃣ Basic Algorithms
🔍 Searching

Linear Search → O(n)

Binary Search → O(log n) (sorted array)

🔄 Sorting

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Purpose:

Faster searching

Cleaner logic

6️⃣ Recursion

Function calling itself.

Logic:

Base condition

Recursive call

Used in:

Tree traversal

Backtracking

Divide & conquer

7️⃣ Mathematical Basics

GCD & LCM

Prime numbers

Modulo arithmetic

Number theory basics


8️⃣ Problem-Solving Approach (Must Follow)

Understand the problem

Think of brute force

Optimize step-by-step

Dry run with examples

Write clean code

Analyze complexity


9️⃣ Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Jumping to optimized solution
❌ Ignoring edge cases
❌ Not analyzing complexity
❌ Memorizing instead of understanding


🔑 Key Takeaway

DSA is not about solving more problems.
It’s about building the right thinking process.

Consistency + Logic = Growth 🚀
