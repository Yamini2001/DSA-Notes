📐 **Concepts of Maths (For DSA & Logic Building)**

Mathematics is the backbone of DSA.

You don’t need advanced math — you need clear logical understanding of a few core concepts.

1️⃣ **Number System**

Understanding numbers helps in counting, comparisons, and optimizations.

Key concepts:

Even & Odd numbers

Prime & Composite numbers

Divisibility rules

Factors & Multiples

Used in:

Loops

Conditions

Number theory problems

2️⃣ **Basic Arithmetic**

Simple operations but powerful logic.

Includes:

Addition, Subtraction

Multiplication, Division

Modulus (%)

Why important:

Used in constraints

Helps avoid overflow

Important for optimization

3️⃣ **GCD & LCM**

GCD: Largest number dividing two numbers

LCM: Smallest common multiple

Logic:

**LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / GCD(a, b)**


Used in:

Fractions

Scheduling

Optimization problems

4️⃣ **Prime Numbers**

Numbers divisible only by 1 and itself.

Key logic:

Check till √n

Use Sieve for multiple queries

Used in:

Factorization

Cryptography basics

Competitive programming

5️⃣ **Modular Arithmetic**

Used when numbers are very large.

Important rules:

(a + b) % m

(a × b) % m

Used in:

Large calculations

Hashing

Competitive coding

6️⃣ **Powers & Exponents**

Understanding growth and limits.

Includes:

Powers (2ⁿ)

Square root logic

Logarithms basics

Used in:

Time complexity

Binary search

Recursion depth

7️⃣ **Permutations & Combinations (Basics)**

Used to calculate possible outcomes.

Permutation → Order matters

Combination → Order doesn’t matter

Used in:

Counting problems

Backtracking

Probability logic

8️⃣ **Probability (Basics)**

Understanding chance.

Used in:

Expected outcomes

Randomized algorithms

9️⃣ **Mathematical Patterns**

Recognizing patterns reduces time complexity.

Examples:

Arithmetic progression

Geometric progression

Prefix sums

🔑 **How Maths Improves Logic Building**

✔ Improves analytical thinking
✔ Helps optimize brute-force solutions
✔ Builds confidence in problem solving
✔ Reduces unnecessary loops

🎯 **Key Takeaway**

You don’t need to be great at maths.
You need to be clear with fundamentals.

Strong maths concepts = Strong DSA logic 🚀
